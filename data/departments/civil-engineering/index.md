- **Non Destructive Testing Laboratory**

Non-destructive testing (NDT) is the process of inspecting, testing, or evaluating materials, components or assemblies for discontinuities, or differences in characteristics without destroying the serviceability of the part or system. In other words, when the inspection or test is completed the part can still be used.
The laboratory is facilitated with Anemometer, Ultrasonic Pulse velocity meter, Rebound hammer, Penetrometer, Hygrometer, Lux meter , Digital thermometer etc.
