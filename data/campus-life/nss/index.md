National Service Scheme (NSS) was constituted in 1969, the year which marks Mahatma Gandhi’s 100th Birthday, as a student youth service programme. It is an educational experiment in community service which aims at involving under-graduate students on a voluntary basis in various activities of social service and national development, students to understand and appreciate the problems of the community, awaken social consciousness and inculcate in them a sense of dignity of labour. The Motto of NSS “Not Me But You”, reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for self-less service. NSS helps the students develop appreciation to other person’s point of view and also show consideration to other living beings. The philosophy of the NSS is well reflected in this motto, which underlines on the belief that the welfare of an individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare of the society on the whole and therefore, the NSS volunteers shall strive for the well-being of the society.
