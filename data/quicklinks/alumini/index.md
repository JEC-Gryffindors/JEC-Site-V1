#####INNOVATE’19

In order to attract greater number of students to engineering stream, College conducted Techfest-INNOVATE’19, for all nearby higher secondary and high school students. Nearly two thousand brochures were distributed amongst the passed out HSS students.

The basic idea behind the brochure distribution is that, all HSS passed students seek for admission in various fields of interest. But sometimes due to lack of awareness and guidance, some of the courses remain untold to them. By conducting this drive, it will be easier to promote the courses and facilities provided by our college to the passed-out students, so that they get correct options to choose for their career.

CEK Alumni actively participated and contributed to the Techfest and brochure distribution.
